People

Alluvia: smart mage.  Rather independent.  Storyline inclueds finding lost information for guilds and developing specialized magic.  Rather uninvolved in the trading business.

Oath: knightish type as default, gains mimick ability, is the trader for the party.

Bahalla: poet/theif.  meets up early on and has significant contacts and knowledge in trading

Boru: paladin type.  meets up a little later on and is involved in the main chapter 1 quest of rooting out the rebellion and thieves.  Gets attacked for being a bit too disloyal when the nobility orders the killing of a woman

(discussion after battle: B: that was unacceptable.  Others: going against orders like that is unacceptable, you will need to die too.  Trading party shows up and soldiers just assume that the trading party is helping the enemy (which it should be probably) and includes them in the attack.)
